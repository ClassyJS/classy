# mkdirp

Like `mkdir -p`, but in node.js!

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/node-mkdirp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-mkdirp)

# example

## pow.js

```js
var mkdirp = require('mkdirp');
    
mkdirp('/tmp/foo/bar/baz', function (err) {
    if (err) console.error(err)
    else console.log('pow!')
});
```

Output

```
pow!
```

And now /tmp/foo/bar/baz exists, huzzah!

# methods

```js
var mkdirp = require('mkdirp');
```

## mkdirp(dir, mode, cb)

Create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at `dir` with octal
permission string `mode`.

If `mode` isn't specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.

`cb(err, made)` fires with the error or the first directory `made`
that had to be created, if any.

## mkdirp.sync(dir, mode)

Synchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at `dir`
with octal permission string `mode`.

If `mode` isn't specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.

Returns the first directory that had to be created, if any.

# usage

This package also ships with a `mkdirp` command.

```
usage: mkdirp [DIR1,DIR2..] {OPTIONS}

  Create each supplied directory including any necessary parent directories that
  don't yet exist.
  
  If the directory already exists, do nothing.

OPTIONS are:

  -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal
               permission string.

```
